# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As someone who is interested in career searching within the world of coding but has limited understanding of coding itself, the idea of treading through unknown territory is daunting. However, it is an adventure I am determined to embark upon to seek a happier life.
This project is designed as a personal reference guide and library of knowledge I have acquired over the course of my time spent during Rutgers Coding Boot Camp. The problem it was created to solve is quite simple: to help solve coding problems with an array of defined terms and information.
